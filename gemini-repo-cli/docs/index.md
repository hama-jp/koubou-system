# Gemini Repo CLI Documentation

Welcome to the documentation for the Gemini Repo CLI! This tool allows you to leverage the power of Google's Gemini models to generate code, documentation, and other content based on the context of your code repository.

## Overview

The Gemini Repo CLI provides a command-line interface for interacting with the Google Gemini API. It allows you to:

* Generate code snippets based on existing code in your repository.
* Generate documentation for your code.
* Automate other content generation tasks related to your codebase.

The tool works by taking a prompt and a set of context files from your repository as input. It then uses the Gemini API to generate content based on this information.

## Key Features

* **Context-Aware Generation:**  Leverages existing code files as context for more accurate and relevant content generation.
* **Customizable Prompts:**  Allows you to tailor the generation process with specific prompts.
* **Model Selection:** Supports different Gemini models for varying performance and cost.
* **Easy Integration:**  Simple command-line interface for seamless integration into your development workflow.
