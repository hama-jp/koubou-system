"""Utility decorator to measure function execution time.

The :func:`timeit` decorator records the time just before a function
call and just after it returns, then prints the elapsed time.

Example usage::

    from timer_decorator import timeit

    @timeit
    def slow_function():
        time.sleep(1)

    slow_function()  # prints "slow_function executed in 1.0010s"

This module intentionally only prints the timing; callers can
capture the duration if needed by inspecting the printed output or
by extending the decorator.

    The decorator prints the elapsed time to standard output in a

    ``__name__`` and ``__doc__`` attributes via :func:`functools.wraps`.
