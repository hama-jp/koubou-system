## ðŸ“Š Performance Data

### Recent Test Results (Reference Values)
- **Total processed**: 71 items / 22â€¯min = **3.2 items/min**
- **Success rate**: 100â€¯%
- **Parallel processing benefit**: ~1.6Ã— efficiency increase
- **Worker cost**: GPU usage only

### Time Estimates
- **General tasks (Ollama)**: ~15â€“20â€¯s each
- **Code tasks (Codex)**: ~20â€“30â€¯s each
- **Complex tasks**: 30â€“60â€¯s

## âš¡ Checking Worker Status

### 1. Dashboard

```
http://localhost:8080
- IDLE    â†’ Ready immediately
- WORKING â†’ Task in progress
- PROCESSING â†’ LLM inference (seconds to minutes)
```

### 2. From the Command Line

```bash
# Worker details
sqlite3 .koubou/db/koubou.db "SELECT worker_id, status, completed_tasks FROM workers WHERE status != 'offline';"

# Pending tasks count
sqlite3 .koubou/db/koubou.db "SELECT COUNT(*) FROM task_master WHERE status='pending';"
```

## ðŸ§  Advanced Decision Criteria

### When to strongly recommend delegation
- Similar task quantity â‰¥â€¯5
- Expected runtime â‰¥â€¯1â€¯hour
- Night or weekend work
- Master has other critical tasks
- â‰¥â€¯2 workers IDLE

### When to let the master handle it
- New task type (no precedent)
- Requires error handling or debugging
- Needs external system integration
- Final quality judgement matters
- Expected finish <â€¯15â€¯min

### If in doubt
1. Delegate a single test task
2. Verify quality before delegating the rest
3. Consider parallel work: master + workers

## ðŸ”§ Tips for Worker Management

### Efficient use
- **Batch processing**: group similar tasks
- **Time distribution**: run long tasks during night
- **Monitoring**: keep an eye on the dashboard

### When problems arise
```bash
# Force restart a worker
pkill -f "local_worker"
WORKER_ID=emergency_worker .koubou/venv/bin/python .koubou/scripts/workers/local_worker.py &

# Restart the whole system
.koubou/start_system.sh
```

## ðŸ“ˆ Continuous Improvement

### Regular checks
- **Monthly**: review worker success rate
- **Weekly**: track processing time trends
- **Daily**: monitor dashboard activity

### Optimization points
- Adjust number of workers (1â€“3 is optimal)
- Optimize per task type
- Improve GPU usage efficiency

**The masterâ€™s time is precious. Delegating appropriately lets them focus on creative work!**
